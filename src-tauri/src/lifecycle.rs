//! Application Lifecycle Management
//!
//! Provides a centralized registry for managing the lifecycle of all long-running
//! background tasks (watchers, workers, servers). Uses hierarchical `CancellationToken`s
//! for cooperative shutdown and retains `JoinHandle`s for graceful await on termination.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! LifecycleRegistry (root CancellationToken)
//!  ├── watcher_token_1 (child)
//!  ├── watcher_token_2 (child)
//!  ├── thumbnail_worker_token (child)
//!  └── streaming_server_token (child)
//!       ├── cleanup_process_token (grandchild)
//!       └── cleanup_linear_token (grandchild)
//! ```
//!
//! Cancelling the root token propagates to all children, enabling full app shutdown.
//! Individual subsystems can also be stopped independently via their child tokens.
